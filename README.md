### Konsultaner

I've been a software developer for about 25 years now and 15 years as a full-stack professional. I love coding. I love clean code. I love simplicity. I love to have everything running as smooth as possible. Just like everyone here ðŸ˜„

I'm running the company [Konsultaner](https://www.konsultaner.de/) with my buddy and love doing it ever since. We produce software like simple websites, apps, web applications, middleware applications, database tasks, infastructure with ansible, ai stuff and custom ERP systems. I like to open source as much as possible and love contibuting to projects I use in my daily work.

My latest tech stack looks like this

- [WAMP-Proto](https://github.com/wamp-proto/wamp-proto)
- Connectanum, my own Java WAMP implementation
- Flutter, Dart and [connectanum-dart](https://github.com/konsultaner/connectanum-dart)
- [ArangoDB](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb)
- OpenAi API
